# `capsule/app/`: game data (optional)

Hellbox runs the **shareware `DOOM1.WAD`**, which the MicroVM image build fetches automatically at
build time from the pinned URL and SHA in `../wad-source.json`. For the default demo this directory
can be **empty**; you do not need to supply anything.

Drop a file here only to **override or extend** the game data:

- Put your own **IWAD** (e.g. a different `DOOM1.WAD`) here and the build uses it instead of
  fetching one. The capsule loads the first `*.wad` it finds under `/home/app/app`.
- Add **PWADs** or other assets alongside it to mod the demo.

Payloads are git-ignored (`*.wad`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, etc.; see `.gitignore`), so no game data
lands in the repo. By default, Hellbox downloads the shareware `DOOM1.WAD` and builds GPLv2
Chocolate Doom at build time; it does not include or distribute the retail `DOOM.WAD` /
`DOOM2.WAD`.
